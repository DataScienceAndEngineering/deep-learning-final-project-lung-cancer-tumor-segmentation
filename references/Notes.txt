Pre-trained vs not pre-trained
3d conv vs 2d
classification vs segmentation


Semantic segmentation every pixel is identified this is in classification

Recongition Localization: put a box around an area

Use a classification algorithim
Segmentation more complicated but takes the spatial awareness
MULTI LABEL CLASSIFICATION


What is the aim of the project currently
	Test multiple models and compare what works the best for volumetric segmentation
	
What we've accomplished in the past week
	Data augmentation
	3d Conv Net Work
	2d Conv Net work
	Classifiers

What blockers we need to ask you about
	Working with big data

What we aim to achieve
	WE aim to do a compartivie analysis of 3 models for volumetric segmentation
	Multi Channel 2d convoultion
	3d Convoultion
	Slice Classification

There are other images besides accuracy that could work
Do regularization
Have the same evaluation 
Not nearly a bitch this time around
Create a benchmark
What are we expecting for a dice loss
We don't know whats good or bad we need to find a better way of debugging
